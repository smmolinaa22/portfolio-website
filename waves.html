            <h1><span>Waves UX Design Case Study</span></h1>
            <p>
                Context: CareerFoundry UX Design Certificate
                <br>
                Roles: UX Design, User Research, Information Architecture
                <br>
                About: Waves is a water mobile app created to connect people with easy to understand wind, wave, and weather
                information for quick decision making on their water days.
            </p>
        </div></div>

                <h1>The Process</h1>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <h4>Who are we designing for and what do they need? We completed a competitive analysis, SWOT analysis, and user surveys to discover more.</h4>
                        <h3>Key Research Insights</h3>
                        <h4>Users needed a mobile app to access water weather conditions to enjoy their leisure water activities.</h4>
                        <p>When completing our research, we learned:
                            <ol>
                                <li>No apps on the market currently cater to leisurely water goers (discovered via competitive analysis and SWOT)</li>
                                <li>Majority of participants surveyed reported their primary purpose during water activities is for leisure (discovered via surveys)</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <!--add thumbnails to enlarge: competitive analysis, SWOT, and user interviews-->
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>POV</h2>
                        <p>Using the information and perspective gained from user interviews, we created personas to represent members of 
                        our target audience. These personas helped us stay user-centered throughout our design process.</p>
                        <!--add thumbnails to enlarge: personas-->

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Ideation</h2>
                        <h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>user journey mapping</li>
                                <li>creating user flows</li>
                                <li>creating and refining our sitemap</li>
                            </ul>
                        </h4>
                        <h3>User Journey Mapping</h3>
                        <p>User journey mapping helped us to understand the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of our personas when 
                            completing tasks. </p>
                        <p>By empathizing with our users, we learned that the app needs to:
                            <ul>
                            <li>provide quick, accurate, and detailed weather and water conditions</li>
                            <li>have trustworthy information from other users (i.e., reviews and pictures)</li>
                            <li>have advanced filters so users can find the locations they want.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                
                        <h3>Creating User Flows and Refining Our Sitemap</h3>
                        <p>We started creating user flows to visualize the steps of a task our user personas would take when using the app.</p>
                        <!--add thumbnail or image of userflows-->
                        <picture>

                        </picture>
                        <p>We then began expanding our product’s information architecture, creating a sitemap, which gave structure and 
                        organization to our ideas.</p>
                        <!--add thumbnail or pic of sitemap-->
                        <picture>
                            <source srcset="img/waves/sitemap@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

                    <div>
                        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                        <h4>With our sitemap created, we then created wireframes showcasing 3 core features:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Viewing Saved Locations</li>
                                <li>Applying Filters during Search</li>
                                <li>Reading Reviews</li>
                            </ul>
                        </h4>
                        <p>Below is the progression of our Applying Filters during Search feature. We used pen and paper for our low 
                        fidelity wireframes and Figma for the mid and high fidelity wireframes.</p>
                        <!--add low to hifi progression, make thumbnail?-->

                    <div>
                        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                        <p>After completing usability testing with our clickable prototype, we identified the top 5 issues our participants were 
                        having. We then identified and implemented solutions to address these issues.</p>
                        <div>
                            <h4>1. Confusion with the hamburger menu function</h4>
                            <p>Solution: Change hamburger menu to a settings menu with radio buttons or show/hide options within the settings 
                            page.</p>
                            <h4>2. Scrolling up/down is not obvious on scrollable pages</h4>
                            <p>Solution: Place a scroll bar/scroll indicator on the right side of the page for scrollable pages, 
                            specifically, the home and location pages.</p>
                            <h4>3. Redundant buttons (i.e. filter icon and “more filters” drop down) may cause confusion with navigation</h4>
                            <p>Solution: Change the current filter icon to a list view icon; keep the “more filters” drop down the same.</p>
                            <h4>4. Prototype linking is not smooth when using the “applying filters” feature</h4>
                            <p>Solution: Fix prototype linking in Figma to be more dynamic rather than linear. Some pages are not linked 
                            correctly and do not fully represent the Search/Filters features.</p>
                            <h4>5. Users cannot see pictures when looking at reviews / users cannot see reviews</h4> 
                            <p>Solution: Place the user’s review under the enlarged picture / place thumbnails of pictures included with the 
                            review in the Reviews tab.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Iterative Design and Prototyping</h2>
                        <p>Our design went through several iterations. We focused on fixing the identified issues, implementing design 
                            principles, and increasing accessibility. We also improved our design via collaboration and feedback from 
                            peers. Below is the progression of our Log In page following these iterations.</p>
                            <!--add image/thumbnail of prototype iterations, change to thumbnail?-->

                    <h2>Reflection and Feedback</h2>
                    <p>Developing Waves from start to finish was a rewarding and challenging process. I grew my strengths in using 
                        different design tools (i.e. Figma), completing thorough user research, collaborative design with peers, 
                        effectively managing time within a project, and prioritizing accessibility in design.

                        Moving forward, I now have a more systematic way of approaching new problems. I will be learning more about 
                        accessibility in design, other design software, and collaboration with other disciplines to further my design 
                        growth and strengths.</p>
                    <div>
                        <h4>
                            “This is a good app for those looking for niche water spots. It shows them what and where.”
                            <br>
                            “It’s really good about giving weather info and a location to influence where you go to do a water activity.”
                            <br>
                            “I love the feature to customize the home page!”

                            “The UI of the home page is beautiful.”

                            “I like this aesthetic very much. Playful and inviting.”

                    <h2>Design Language System</h2>
                    <p>We created a design language system and style guide to guide our UI choices. These tools helped our design stay 
                        uniform and consistent from page to page. These tools also help communicate our design choices to other designers 
                        or developers that may work on the project.</p>
